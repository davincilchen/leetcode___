// Check whether two strings are anagram of each other in Go programming language.

// Check by characters count:

// setup map structures to count the characters of both strings [2].
// compare if the two map structures are equal [3] via reflect.DeepEqual.
// Another way to check anagram is by sorting, see [1].
