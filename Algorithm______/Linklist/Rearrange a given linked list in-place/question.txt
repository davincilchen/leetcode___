Rearrange a given linked list in-place.
Difficulty Level : Medium
Last Updated : 24 Jun, 2021
Given a singly linked list L0 -> L1 -> … -> Ln-1 -> Ln. 
Rearrange the nodes in the list so that the new formed list is : 
L0 -> Ln -> L1 -> Ln-1 -> L2 -> Ln-2 …
You are required to do this in place without altering the nodes’ values. 

Examples: 

Input:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
Output: 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3

Input:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Output: 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE” first, before moving on to the solution.
Simple Solution

1) Initialize current node as head.
2) While next of current node is not null, do following
    a) Find the last node, remove it from the end and insert it as next
       of the current node.
    b) Move current to next to next of current
The time complexity of the above simple solution is O(n2) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

Better Solution 
1) Copy contents of the given linked list to a vector. 
2) Rearrange the given vector by swapping nodes from both ends. 
3) Copy the modified vector back to the linked list.

Thanks to Arushi Dhamija for suggesting this approach.

Efficient Solution:

1) Find the middle point using tortoise and hare method.
2) Split the linked list into two halves using found middle point in step 1.
3) Reverse the second half.
4) Do alternate merge of first and second halves.
The Time Complexity of this solution is O(n). 

Below is the implementation of this method.
